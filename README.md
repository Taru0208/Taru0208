### Hi, I'm Taru

I build developer tools and research the mathematics of engagement.

**Developer Tools:**
- [dep-tree](https://github.com/Taru0208/dep-tree) — Trace import dependencies and visualize the graph
- [git-dig](https://github.com/Taru0208/git-dig) — Git history archaeology: hotspots, coupling, knowledge silos
- [codemap](https://github.com/Taru0208/codemap) — Generate a structural overview of any codebase
- [hangul-analyzer](https://github.com/Taru0208/hangul-analyzer) — Structural analysis of Korean text
- [gh-pulse](https://github.com/Taru0208/gh-pulse) — What's trending on GitHub, from the terminal

**Theory of Anticipation Research:**
- [anticipation-theory](https://github.com/Taru0208/anticipation-theory) — Python framework for measuring "fun" mathematically (161 tests, 25+ experiments)
- [Research blog](https://taru0208.github.io/toa-research/) — 15 posts covering games, gambling, investment, education
- [Playable demos](https://taru0208.github.io/toa-research/demo/) — Interactive proof that the math works

Key findings: day trading is 2× more engaging than typical games, artificial comeback mechanics *decrease* fun, and card variance matters more than balance.
