### Hi, I'm Taru

I build developer tools and research the mathematics of game design.

**Developer Tools:**
- [dep-tree](https://github.com/Taru0208/dep-tree) — Trace import dependencies and visualize the graph
- [git-dig](https://github.com/Taru0208/git-dig) — Git history archaeology: hotspots, coupling, knowledge silos
- [codemap](https://github.com/Taru0208/codemap) — Generate a structural overview of any codebase
- [hangul-analyzer](https://github.com/Taru0208/hangul-analyzer) — Structural analysis of Korean text
- [api-forge](https://github.com/Taru0208/api-forge) — All-in-one utility API: text, encoding, QR codes, language detection, and more (119 endpoints) — [Live Docs](https://api-forge.quietnode.workers.dev/docs)

**Theory of Anticipation Research:**
- [anticipation-theory](https://github.com/Taru0208/anticipation-theory) — Python framework for measuring "fun" in games (276 tests, 16 game models)
- [▶ Design Lab](https://taru0208.github.io/toa-research/design-lab/) — Play two versions of the same game. Same rules, different numbers. Feel the difference.
- [▶ Calculator](https://taru0208.github.io/toa-research/calculator/) — Compute GDS, agency, and fun scores for your game design

Key finding: in many games, the boring safe strategy wins. By adjusting the numbers, we can make the exciting strategy also the winning strategy — eliminating the trade-off entirely.
